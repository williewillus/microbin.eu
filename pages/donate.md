# Donate

MicroBin is free to use and yours to keep forever. Development, maintanence and user support however takes a lot of time and effort. There is no requirement for you to give anything back, but if you are in the position where you can do that, donations go a long way in supporting the project.

If you are making a donation, please use either of the two methods below or reach out to info@microbin.eu to request another method.

Ko-Fi donations:

# Sponsor

Are you looking to support a FOSS project and promote your product or organisation at the same time? We are currently looking for long-term sponsors who may have their hardware/software related logos or advertisements placed on MicroBin.eu and on our GitHub repository.
